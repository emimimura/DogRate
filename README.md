# Dog Rating

<p>WeRateDogs is a Twitter account  (@dog_rates) that rates people’s dogs.  With its humorous comments and  unconventional rating system, the account have attracted 5.85 million followers (as of March 3, 2018) and has even received international media coverage.</p>

<p>WeRateDogs kindly downloaded and sent over their Twitter archive for this project, and with additional data obtained from the Twitter API and an image predictions file provided by Udacity, I have come up with some insights on people’s love for dogs.</p>

<p>This project was done in Jupyter Notebook.</p>
